A child rejected was Dhruva, helpless and pitiable besides,
Implored the hidden Lord, who strode to his side;
Among the galaxies He, the mine of love, gave him an abode,
The polar star of undying fame He chose, as to Him it behove,
Never does He, proud of His devotees, fail them in love. рее  117 рее
